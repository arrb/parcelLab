# Infrastructure

This was set up using Heroku, express, sqllite, and ReactJS. 
First, Heroku was setup with express to deploy the site easily. Then, a database was setup. Since, I didn't want to make the back end too complicated,
I decided to use sqllite instead of Postgress in which it was easy to insert values from CSV files. 

I decided to just have one API call that would return all the data I needed based on the email address provided just to finish it faster. 

Then, the front end was inspired by the colors parcellab has on its site.
